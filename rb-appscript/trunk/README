Appscript Read Me

======================================================================
ABOUT

Ruby appscript (rb-appscript) is a high-level Apple event bridge for the Ruby scripting language. rb-appscript is closely based on the Python appscript (py-appscript) bridge.

See the doc folder for more information.

======================================================================
REQUIREMENTS

- Mac OS X 10.3+
- Ruby 1.8+

======================================================================
INSTALLATION

$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make
$ sudo make install

-------

Please note that the version of Ruby included with Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is missing the header files needed to build appscript on PPC-based Macs. Tiger users can avoid this issue by installing the latest version of Ruby from <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/> and updating their shell login profiles to suit.

======================================================================
NOTES

- Developer tools for exporting application dictionaries (ASDictionary) and converting application commands from AppleScript to appscript syntax (ASTranslate) are available separately:

	http://appscript.sourceforge.net/tools.html

- This is a beta release. Please file bug reports if you encounter any problems.

- rb-appscript 0.5.2 contains bug and compatibility fixes; see the CHANGES file and documentation for details.

- rb-appscript currently provides 64-bit support for OS X 10.5 in the following modules: AE, AEM, Appscript. The OSAX module provides partial 64-bit support; see the osax manual for details.

- ASDictionary 0.11.3 or later is required to use rb-appscript's built-in #help method. If ASDictionary isn't installed, interactive help won't be available but appscript will continue to operate as normal.
