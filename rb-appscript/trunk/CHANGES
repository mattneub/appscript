2006-11-29 -- 0.2.1

- renamed AS module to Appscript. An 'AS' alias is temporarily provided for backwards compatibility but this will be removed in a future release. Users should update their scripts accordingly.

- _appscript/referencerenderer.rb no longer prefixes 'AS.' to reference representation strings

- added #app, #con and #its instance methods to Appscript module to allow clients to include appscript methods and classes in other modules via 'include Appscript'; updated sample scripts and documentation to show this

- OSAX.scripting_additions now returns unique sorted names

- added MacTypes::Alias.url, MacTypes::Alias#url, MacTypes::File_URL.url, MacTypes::File_URL#url methods for working with file url strings

- OSAX::ScriptingAddition#to_s and #inspect now render scripting addition's name correctly

- removed unused AE.pid_to_psn method


2006-11-20 -- 0.2.0

- removed path expansion in FindApp#byName, MacFile::Alias#at, MacFile::FileURL#at

- changed default send flags to KAE::KAECanSwitchLayer + KAE::KAEWaitReply (same as AppleScript)

- aliased AE::MacOSError#number to #to_i; added #to_s and #inspect methods

- added #to_s and #inspect methods to AE::AEDesc

- fixed undefined variable bug in FindApp#byName when raising an ApplicationNotFoundError

- added osax module and documentation

- added event handling code to rbae.c (not yet fully tested)

- added gemspec for source-based gem

- made Reference class's AS_appdata and AS_aemreference instance variables writeable as well as readable - this'll make it easier to inject workarounds (e.g. modified pack/unpack routines) for occasional application flaws

- added sample scripts: Organize_Mail_messages.rb, Create_daily_iCal_todos.rb, Simple_Finder_GUI_Scripting.rb, Set_iChat_status.rb

- now always packs a subject attribute (KAE::TypeSubjectAttr); this is normally a null descriptor. (Note: AS includes a subject attribute for commands whose direct parameter isn't a reference, e.g. make. Photoshop CS2's make command requires either an 'at' parameter or subject attribute and throws an error if it doesn't get one. Including a subject attribute by default should hopefully prevent any complaints.) [BB]

- removed built-in :telltarget argument to simplify the API a bit. Now, if a command is called on a reference and already has a direct parameter, the reference is packed as the subject attribute instead. Also, 'telltarget' is no longer a reserved word.

- true and false are now packed as AEDescs of typeTrue and typeFalse (same as AppleScript), not typeBoolean [BB]

- when hashes containing a :class or AEType.new('pcls') key whose value is a Symbol or AEBaseType instance are packed, the resulting AEDesc is now coerced to that type (previously the class property was packed as just another key-value pair, and the result was an AEDesc of typeAERecord) [BB]

- codecs module now unpacks a record-like AEDesc with an unknown type as a hash containing an additional 'class' property that indicates the original type (i.e. same as AppleScript)

- aliased AEM::CommandError#number to #to_i

- where property and element names are the same (e.g. file, text in BBEdit), appscript now packs this as a property specifier, unless the name is 'text', in which case it's packed as an elements specifier (i.e. [hopefully] same as AppleScript)

- renamed macfile.rb/MacFile module to mactypes.rb/MacTypes

- renamed MacTypes::Alias, MacTypes::MacFileURL methods: 

	Alias.at -> Alias.path
	FileURL.at -> FileURL.path
	Alias.newDesc -> Alias.desc
	FileURL.newDesc -> FileURL.desc

- renamed AS.app methods:

	app#byName -> app#by_name
	app#byCreator -> app#by_creator
	app#byID -> app#by_id
	app#byPID -> app#by_pid
	app#byURL -> app#by_url

- renamed appscript reference methods:

	startswith -> starts_with
	endswith -> ends_with
	isin -> is_in
	doesnotstartwith -> does_not_start_with
	doesnotendwith -> does_not_end_with
	doesnotcontain -> does_not_contain
	isnotin -> is_not_in

- renamed built-in appscript command parameters:

	:waitreply -> :wait_reply
	:resulttype -> :result_type

- renamed AEM::Application methods:

	Application.newPath -> Application.by_path
	Application.newURL -> Application.by_url
	Application.newPID -> Application.by_pid
	Application.newAEDesc -> Application.by_desc

- renamed aem reference methods:

	byindex -> by_index
	byname -> by_name
	byid -> by_id
	byrange -> by_range
	byfilter -> by_filter
	startswith -> starts_with
	endswith -> ends_with
	isin -> is_in

- renamed FindApp methods:

	FindApp.byName -> FindApp.by_name
	FindApp.byCreator -> FindApp.by_creator
	FindApp.byID -> FindApp.by_id

- changed type names in defaultterminology.rb to be more AppleScript-like, e.g. :String -> :string, :MissingValue -> :missing_value (note that there are still a few deliberate differences, e.g. :float instead of :real)

- added month and weekday name-code definitions to defaultterminology.rb

- changed internal variable and method names to follow Ruby style guidelines

- added MacTypes::Units class

- added add_unit_types method to Codecs class, allowing additional unit type definitions to be added

- fixed appscript reference rendering bug where property/element names could get muddled (e.g. 'document' property would appear as 'documents')

- fixed wierd rendering bug where rendered references would be invisible if client script contained an 'app' method of its own (Ruby was invoking this instead of ReferenceRenderer#method_missing)

- moved findapp.rb and mactypes.rb to _aem/ (they're already re-exported by aem.rb, appscript.rb, etc. so clients don't need to require them directly)

- 'help' is now a reserved word (though is not currently implemented)

- Attempting to pack invalid UTF8 strings now raises TypeError instead of AEM::NotUTF8TextError

- changed AEM::Application#running? to AEM::Application.is_running?(path)

- added aem manual

- replaced big if...elsif... block in Codecs#pack with case block

- removed AEM::AEEventName (the 'evnt' type, cEventIdentifier, is used by OSAGetHandlerNames)

- updated kae.rb; now contains constants scraped from the following OS X 10.4u SDK frameworks: 
	AE.framework (all headers)
	Carbon.framework (AEInteraction.h only)
	OpenScripting.framework (all headers except FinderRegistry.h)

- Connect.local_app_by_pid now returns an AEDesc of typeKernelProcessID

- added basic support for equality tests and hashing to MacFile::Alias and MacFile::URL. Note that it only tests for exact data equality; two objects that identify the same filesystem object/location by different means, using paths of different case, etc. will test as false.

- adjusted packing of 'make' command so that if target reference is typeObjectSpecifier then it's packed as the subject attribute but if it's typeInsertionLoc it's packed as an 'at' parameter (this avoids a bug in Cocoa Scripting where packing an insertion location as the subject attribute results in an error when CS tries to coerce it to an object specifier)

- fixed various bugs in aem's transaction-handling code

- added #abort_transaction and added optional 'session' argument to #start_transaction in AEM::Application and AS::Application


2006-10-23 -- 0.1.6

- improved test_aemreference.rb

- fixed bug in aemreference.rb where comparing two non-equivalent aem references could return true

- simplified four-char-code conversion routines in codecs.rb

- AS::Reference#methods now returns names of application-defined properties, elements and commands in addition to names of built-in methods [MN]

- AS::Reference#respond_to? now returns true for names of application-defined properties, elements and commands in addition to names of built-in methods [MN]

- removed rbosadict; use ASDictionary.app instead (available from <http://appscript.sourceforge.net>)

- removed AS::Application#useterminology; added optional 'terms' argument to Application constructors instead

- in Terminology module, changed timeout for ascrgdte event from 120 to 30 sec

- added dump tool + documentation

- added info to manual on scripting non-stay-open applications

- removed MacFile::Alias#newPath and MacFile::FileURL#newPath constructors (use #at instead)

- changed MacFile::Alias#to_s and MacFile::FileURL#to_s to return plain path string instead of object representation (use #inspect for that)

- removed MacFile::Alias#path and MacFile::FileURL#path (use #to_s instead)

- added macfile manual

- Connect.launch_app no longer waits for reply/error when sending a launch event to an already running application


2006-10-18 -- 0.1.5

- renamed MacFile::Alias#newPath, MacFile::FileURL#newPath to Alias#at and FileURL#at for conciseness; e.g.: FileURL.at("/some/path"). Note: newPath methods will be removed in 0.2.0.

- appscript module now packs UInt32 csig attributes correctly [DH]

- fixed little-endian bugs when packing and unpacking typeSInt64 and typeLongDateTime

- packing and unpacking typeLongDateTime AEDescs is now about as accurate as can be expected, given the inherent problems of LongDateTime (i.e. UCConvertLongDateTimeToCFAbsoluteTime and UCConvertCFAbsoluteTimeToLongDateTime have off-by-an-hour [or whatever the local difference is] inaccuracies at ST/DST/ST boundaries)

- improved error reporting in MacFile module: creating a MacFile::Alias object with a path to a non-existent filesystem object, getting path for MacFile::Alias object that no longer identifies a valid filesystem object, etc. now raises MacFile::FileNotFoundError instead of various MacOSErrors

- comparison methods' arguments now display correctly when to_s/inspect is called on its-based references

- its-based aem references now correctly unpack KAEContains comparison descriptors as 'reference.isin(value)', rather than trying to unpack them incorrectly as 'value.contains(reference)'

- first/middle/last/any references now compare correctly with identical references that have been previously packed and unpacked. Previously the codecs module was unpacking them with different _key attributes, so equality tests would always return false even when the two references were identical.

- Attempting to pack invalid UTF8 strings now raises AEM::NotUTF8TextError rather than AE::MacOSError -1700.

- fixed launch method (was calling non-existent Connect.launch, not Connect.launchApp)

- attempting to retrieve aete resource from an application that doesn't have any terminology no longer raises 'resource not found' (-192) error

- AEM module now re-exports AE::MacOSError class for convenience

- Apple Event Manager-raised errors that occur when sending events are now reported correctly (was giving 'uninitialized constant Send::Event::None' errors)

- appscript referencerenderer module now renders class names in next and previous references correctly

- GenericReference#to_s now includes 'AS.' prefix when rendering string representations of generic references

- fixed ==() methods in appscript Reference and aem Application classes

- implemented eql? methods so aem types, aem references and appscript references should now work correctly as hash keys

- fixed endian bugs in Codecs when unpacking insertion location selectors and comparison and logic operators


2006-10-15 -- 0.1.4

- fixed error message when reporting an unknown parameter (was showing command name, not parameter name)

- fixed bug in TextEdit_demo.rb script (count command's parameter should be :each, not :each_)

- fixed bug where typeBoolean AEDescs would always unpack as true

- fixed bugs when packing and unpacking AEDescs of typeSInt64

- integers between 2*31 and 2**63-1 now pack as typeSInt64, not typeFloat

- [mostly] fixed timezone and winter/summer time bugs; there's probably still problems at the points where DST begins and ends (some of which may be Ruby's fault; this is still to be determined)


2006-10-13 -- 0.1.3

- fixed a bug in appscript where the first argument in a command call would be ignored if it was false or nil [MN]

- changed priority order for determining what an ambiguous keyword (e.g. :workbook in Excel) that may be either a type or enumerator name should be packed as; previously typeEnumerated was the default, now it's typeType [MN]


2006-10-12 -- 0.1.2

- fixed a bug where appscript was unpacking typeEnumerated AEDescs as AEM::AEEnums instead of Symbols [MN]


2006-10-10 -- 0.1.1

- made several corrections and improvements to appscript manual [MN]


2006-10-09 -- 0.1.0

- first release
