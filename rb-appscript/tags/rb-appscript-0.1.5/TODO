TO DO

- figure out how to create top-level app, con, its functions that work correctly; right now, defining:

require "appscript"
def app(*args)
	AS.app(*args)
end

produces reference objects okay, but these objects' to_s method returns empty strings instead of correct representation

- allow users to extract a generic ref from a real ref (to_generic) for comparison purposes. Or vice-versa?

- override 'methods' and 'respond_to?' methods to check for application-defined properties, elements and commands, as well as built-in methods

- improve error reporting; e.g. AE::MacOSError needs to include error number in message string; pack/unpack errors in aem/codecs.rb could have better descriptions and/or represented by a CodecsError class; ae/aem/appscript-defined exception classes aren't quite idiomatic Ruby

- profiling

- finish commenting source code

- add bigger note about UTF8 usage to manual, useful tips (e.g. jcode), etc.

- would be nice if MacFile::FileNotFoundError always showed the failed path (this'd need a bit of Alias Manager glue added to the ae extension)

- MacFile objects should support ==, eql? and hash

- sending 'run' to AS non-stay-open applet causes appscript to hang until timeout error occurs (the ascrgdte event is being sent after the applet's event loop has already stopped):

AS.app('~/foo.app').run

/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/_appscript/terminology.rb:278:in `tablesForApp': Can't get terminology for application (/Users/has/foo.app): uninitialized constant Send::Event::None (RuntimeError)
	from /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/appscript.rb:49:in `_connect'

Need to add note to manual about this (already discusses related issues, but not this exact point).


- following isn't working as it should:

require "appscript"

f = AS.app('~/foo.app')
f.launch
f.run

Applet launches and then quits without doing anything, then waits a minute before launching again, beeping and quitting, then waits another minute before giving a "Can't send Apple event" (-609) error.


- finish writing tests

- remove MacFile::Alias#newPath, MacFile::FileURL#newPath in 0.2.0 (replaced by 'at' methods)

- check OS10.3 (with user-installed Ruby 1.8+) compatibility

- port aem, macfile, findapp manuals
