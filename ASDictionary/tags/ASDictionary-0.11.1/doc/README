ASDictionary

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text or HTML format. It can also be used to generate application 'glues' for use with objc-appscript. Requires Mac OS 10.3.9 or later. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

To install ASDictionary, simply open the ASDictionary-0.10.1.dmg and drag the ASDictionary application to your Applications folder.

To install the asdict command line tool (this is optional), cd to the ASDictionary-0.10.1/bin folder in Terminal and run:

	sudo cp asdict /usr/local/bin && chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/asdict


----------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE

------- To export application dictionaries -------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


------- To generate objc-appscript glues -------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export window.

2. Select the objc-appscript glue format.

3. The ObjC class name prefix for each glue is shown in the Prefix column. The default prefix is the application's name converted to a C-style identifier with the first character always uppercase (e.g. Address Book becomes AddressBook, iCal becomes ICal), but this can be changed by clicking on it and typing a prefix of your choice (e.g. ADBK instead of AddressBook, IC instead of ICal). Take care not to use a prefix that may cause the glue's class names to collide with existing Cocoa classes (e.g. 'NS' is a particularly common prefix and best avoided) otherwise the glue may not compile.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated glue. Each glue folder's name will consist of its class name prefix followed by 'Glue' (e.g. AddressBookGlue, ICGlue).

COMMAND LINE TOOLS

The asdict command line tool can be used to:
- export application dictionaries as plain text and HTML files
- view individual suite, class and command definitions
- display inheritance and containment trees.

Like ASDictionary, asdict supports AppleScript- and appscript-style terminology and can operate in both interactive and non-interactive modes. 

To view the full documentation for asdict, run:

	/usr/local/bin/asdict -h


----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting dictionaries.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. Should this happen, please submit a bug report.

Appscript Support

The appscript bridges for Python and Ruby depend on ASDictionary to support their built-in help systems. You can specify text wrapping options for help system output in ASDictionary's Preferences window.
