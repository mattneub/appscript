TO DO

- note: emptying default typebyname, typebycode tables means that type/enum/property name collisions between AEM and application won't be detected when generating XXConstant class; need to sort this

- finish AEMCodecs specifier unpackers

- all-in-one shortcuts for get, set commands?

- get developer feedback and suggestions on design of command attribute packing and error reporting schemes

- i386 safety? 64-bit safety? GC (-finalize) support?

- finish appscript.terminology support

- finish osaterminology support (should see about implementing a proper extensible plugin architecture)

- should properties and elements also take a direct index/name selector as a convenient shortcut? e.g.:

	[textedit documents: [NSNumber numberWithInt: 3]]
	[textedit documents: @"ReadMe"]

- provide convenience macro(s), e.g.:

	#AEMInt(index) [NSNumber numberWithInt: index]
