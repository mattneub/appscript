<h2>Security Issues</h2>

<p>If including user names and/or passwords in remote application URLs, please note that appscript retains these URLs in both the <code>terminology</code> module's internal cache and in the <code>app</code> objects created with those URLs. Security here is the user's responsibility, as it's their code that creates and retains these objects.</p>


<h2>GUI Scripting</h2>

<p>Non-scriptable applications may in some cases be controlled from Python by using System Events to manipulate their graphical user interface. Note that the &quot;Enable access for assistive devices&quot; checkbox must be selected in the Universal Access system preferences pane for GUI Scripting to work.</p>


<h2>AEDescs</h2>

<p>Some applications (e.g. QuarkXpress) may return values which appscript cannot convert to equivalent Python types. These values are usually of types which are defined, used and understood only by that particular application, and will be represented in Python as raw <code>CarbonX.AE.AEDesc</code> objects (e.g. <code>&lt;_AE.AEDesc object at 0x1181c38&gt;</code>). While there's not much you can do with raw <code>AEDesc</code> objects within Python (it's best just to treat them as opaque types), subsequent commands can pass them back to the application for further use and/or conversion just like any other value.</p>


<h2>aemcodegen</h2>

<p>The <code>appscript.tools.aemcodegen</code> module is an convenience tool for translating appscript commands into their aem equivalents; useful if you want to control applications using the lower-level aem package. See the <code>aemcodegen</code> module's docstring for more information.</p>


<h2>Appscript and threads</h2>

<p>When using appscript in multi-threaded systems, always send application commands from the main thread. (This is a limitation of the underlying aem package, which currently doesn't support receiving reply events on non-main threads.)</p>
