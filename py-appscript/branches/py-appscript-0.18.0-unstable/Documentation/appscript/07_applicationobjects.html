<h2>Creating application objects</h2>


<p>Before you can communicate with a scriptable application, you must call the <code>app</code> object to create an application object. For example:</p>

<pre><code>textedit = app('TextEdit')</code></pre>

<p>The arguments to this call are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>app(name=None, id=None, creator=None, pid=None, url=None, terms=None)
    name : str -- name or POSIX path of local application
    id : str -- bundle id for a local application
    creator : str -- 4-character creator type for a local application
    pid : int -- Unix process id for a local process
    url : str -- eppc URL for a remote process
    terms : module | bool -- if a module, get terminology from it;
            if True, get terminology from target application;
            if False, use built-in terminology only</code></pre>

<p>To target an application you must supply at most <em>one</em> of the following arguments:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>name</code></dt>
<dd>The application's filename or POSIX path, e.g. <code>'TextEdit'</code>, <code>'TextEdit.app'</code>, <code>'/Applications/TextEdit.app'</code>. Where a filename is provided, appscript uses LaunchServices to locate the application. Paths beginning with <code>~</code>, e.g. <code>'~/Dev/MyApp.app'</code>, will be expanded automatically. An <code>.app</code> suffix is optional. For example, given the name <code>'TextEdit'</code>, appscript will first search for an application with that exact name. If none is found, it'll automatically add a <code>.app</code> suffix (<code>'TextEdit.app'</code>) and try again.</dd>

<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd>The application's bundle id, e.g. <code>'com.apple.textedit'</code>. Cocoa applications often have unique bundle ids.</dd>

<dt><code>creator</code></dt>
<dd>A four-character string containing the application's creator type, e.g. <code>'ttxt'</code>. Older Carbon-based applications and some Cocoa-based applications have unique creator types.</dd>

<dt><code>pid</code></dt>
<dd>A valid Unix process id, e.g. <code>5678</code>.</dd>

<dt><code>url</code></dt>
<dd>A URL of form <code>eppc://[user[:password]@host/Application%20Name[?[uid=#]&[pid=#]</code>, e.g. <code>eppc://johnsmith:foobar@office-mac.local/TextEdit?uid=501</code>. The host name/IP address and the process name (case-sensitive) are required. The username and password are optional: if omitted, the OS will obtain this information from the user's keychain or display a dialog asking the user to input one or both values. The user id and process id are also optional; if the process id is given, the process name will be ignored.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If none of these arguments is given, the host process (current application) is targetted.</p>


<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>from appscript import *

ical = app('iCal')

textedit = app('TextEdit.app')

safari = app('/Applications/Safari')

addressbook = app(id='com.apple.addressbook')

quicktimeplayer = app(creator='TVOD')

finder = app(url='eppc://0.0.0.3/Finder')

itunes = app(url='eppc://Jan%20Smith@0.0.0.10/iTunes')

from urllib import quote
address = 'eppc://%s:%s@0.0.0.15/Terminal' % (quote(user), quote(pass))
terminal = app(url=address)</code></pre>


<h2>Basic commands</h2>

<p>All applications should respond to the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>run() -- Run an application.
        Most applications will open an empty, untitled window.

launch() -- Launch an application without sending it a 'run' event.
        Applications that normally open a new, empty document upon
        launch won't.

activate() -- Bring the application to the front.

reopen() -- Reactivate a running application.
        Some applications will open a new untitled window if no window
        is open.

open(directarg) -- Open the specified object(s).
    directarg : anything -- list of objects to open, typically a list
            of macfile.Alias

print_(directarg) -- Print the specified object(s).
    directarg : anything -- list of objects to print, typically a list
            of macfile.Alias

quit(saving) -- Quit an application.
    saving : k.yes | k.ask | k.no -- specifies whether to save
            currently open documents
</code></pre>

<p class="hilitebox">Note that appscript will automatically run an application in order to get its terminology. To start an application with a <code>launch</code> event instead of the usual <code>run</code> event, the <code>launch</code> command must be used immediately after an application object is created (i.e. before constructing any references or sending other commands).</p>

<p>Some applications may provide their own definitions of some or all of these commands, so check their terminology before use.</p>

<p>Appscript also defines <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> commands for any scriptable application that doesn't supply its own definitions:</p>

<pre><code>get(reference) -- Get the data for an object.
    reference -- the object for the command
    Result: anything -- the reply for the command

set(reference, to) -- Set an object's data.
    reference -- the object for the command
    to : anything -- The new value.</code></pre>

<p>Note that these commands are only useful in applications that define an Apple Event Object Model as part of their Apple event interface.</p>


<h2>Transaction support</h2>

<p>Application objects implement three additional methods, <code>starttransaction</code>, <code>endtransaction</code> and <code>aborttransaction</code> that allow a sequence of related commands to be handled as a single operation by applications that support transactions, e.g. FileMaker Pro.</p>

<p>Once the application object's <code>starttransaction</code> method is called, all subsequent commands to that application will be sent as part of the same transaction until <code>endtransaction</code> or <code>aborttransaction</code> is called.</p>

<p>The <code>starttransaction</code> method takes an optional <code>session</code> argument that indicates the specific transaction session to open (in applications that support this).</p>

<p class="hilitebox">Remember to call <code>endtransaction</code> or <code>aborttransaction</code> at the end of every transaction. (This includes transactions interrupted by a raised exception.) If a transaction is accidentally left open, appscript will try to end it automatically when the application object is garbage-collected, but this is not guaranteed to succeed.</p>


<h2>Local application launching notes</h2>

<p>Note: the following information only applies to local applications as appscript cannot directly launch applications on a remote Mac. To control a remote application, the application must be running beforehand or else launched indirectly (e.g. by using the remote Mac's Finder to open it).</p>


<h3>How applications are identified</h3>

<p>When you create an <code>app</code> object by application name, bundle id or creator type, appscript uses LaunchServices to locate an application matching that description. If you have more than one copy of the same application installed, you can identify the one you want by providing its full path, otherwise LaunchServices will identify the newest copy for you.</p>


<h3>Using <code>launch</code> vs <code>run</code></h3>

<p>When appscript launches a non-running application, it normally sends it a <code>run</code> command as part of the launching process. If you wish to avoid this, you should start the application by sending it a <code>launch</code> command before doing anything else. For example:</p>

<pre><code>#/!/usr/bin/env python

te = app('TextEdit')
te.launch()
# other TextEdit-related code goes here...</code></pre>

<p>This is useful when you want to start an application without it going through its normal startup procedure. For example, the above script will launch TextEdit without causing it to display a new, empty document (its usual behaviour).</p>

<p><code>launch</code> is also useful if you need to send a non-running application an <code>open</code> command as its very first instruction. For example, to send an <code>open</code> command to a non-stay-open application that batch processes one or more dropped files then quits again, you must first start it using <code>launch</code>, then send it an <code>open</code> command with the files to process. If you forget to do this, the application will first receive a <code>run</code> command and quit again before the <code>open</code> command can be handled.</p>


<h3>Restarting applications</h3>

<p>As soon as you start to construct a reference or command using a newly created <code>app</code> objects, if the application is not already running then appscript will automatically launch it in order to obtain its terminology. (In earlier versions of appscript, the application was launched as soon as the <code>app</code> object was created, but this behaviour has been modified to give scripts the opportunity to launch it using the <code>launch</code> command instead.)</p>

<p>If the target application has stopped running since the <code>app</code> object was created, trying to send it a command using that <code>app</code> object will result in an invalid connection error (-609), unless that command is <code>run</code> or <code>launch</code>. This restriction prevents appscript accidentally restarting an application that has unexpectedly quit while a script is controlling it. Scripts can restart an application by sending an explicit <code>run</code> or <code>launch</code> command, or by creating a new <code>app</code> object for it.</p>

</p>Note that you can still use <code>app</code> objects to control applications that have been quit <em>and</em> restarted since the <code>app</code> object was created. Appscript will automatically update the <code>app</code> object's process id information as needed.</p>


<p class="hilitebox">There is a known problem with quitting and immediately relaunching an application via appscript, where the relaunch instruction is sent to the application before it has actually quit. This timing issue appears to be the OS's fault; the current workaround for scripts that need to quit and restart applications is to insert a few seconds' delay between the <code>quit</code> and <code>run</code>/<code>launch</code> using the <code>time</code> module's <code>sleep</code> function.</p>
