TO DO

- app('Finder').processes() should now work but doesn't (error -1799 occurs). Find out why.


- Relaunching an application immediately after quitting it often results in an invalid connection error (-609) as LaunchApplication is being called before the application has actually quit. Not sure if there's a practical solution to this - users may just have to live with it.


- Should we use AS-style names (suitably escaped) for default AE types? Pros and cons? (e.g. this'd simplify things when generating dictionaries from sdefs by avoiding extra conversion steps)


- Allow apps to be identified by unix process id. 

- Allow multiple instances of same application to be launched and/or controlled.


- Should we omit non-useful and uncommon AE types from typetables (i.e. drop the automated scraping of Carbon.AppleEvents) and define a fixed set of known types. This would require manual updating whenever Apple add new AE types (not very often), but would get rid of a lot of useless crap that appscript users could do without.


- Introspection support. Users should be able to examine both references' structure and obtain terminology for the referenced properties and elements.


- Decide if an external caching mechanism is still needed. If it is, a file-based cache in /tmp would be the best solution. Cache staleness could be avoided by using process IDs to keep cache synched with running application (though this could still have synching issues with apps that can load scriptable plugins while running), or by retrieving the application's aete each time and comparing it against the aete used to create the cache (a bit slower, since retrieving aetes from some applications takes time).


- Finish Problem Apps chapter


- Improve osadict to provide htmldoc export option, interactive option


- Get all documentation online.


- Proper tests.


- See modules for additional TO DO/TO CHECK/TO DECIDE comments.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: probably reject the following:

- better type-checking for 'ignore' and 'resulttype' args?
