About appscript
===============

Appscript is a high-level, user-friendly Apple event bridge that allows 
you to control AppleScriptable Mac OS X applications from Python.


Requirements
------------

Appscript supports Python 2.3 to 2.7, and Python 3.1 and later.

Appscript requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later.


Installation
------------

Appscript is packaged using the standard Python Distribution Utilities 
(a.k.a. Distutils). To install appscript, cd to the appscript-1.0.0 
directory and run:

  python setup.py install

or:

  python3 setup.py install


Setuptools/Distribute (available from <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi>) 
will be used if installed, otherwise setup.py will revert to Distutils.

Building appscript from source requires the gcc compiler supplied with 
Apple's Xcode IDE. Xcode can be obtained from Mac OS X installer disks
or <http://developer.apple.com>.


Notes
-----

- Python 2.x documentation and sample scripts can be found in the 
  appscript_2x/doc and appscript_2x/sample directories.

- Python 3.x documentation and sample scripts can be found in the 
  appscript_3x/doc and appscript_3x/sample directories.

- Developer tools for exporting application dictionaries (ASDictionary) 
  and converting application commands from AppleScript to appscript 
  syntax (ASTranslate) are available separately:

    http://appscript.sourceforge.net/tools.html

  ASDictionary 0.13.1 or later is also required to use appscript's built-in 
  help() method. If ASDictionary isn't installed, interactive help won't be 
  available but appscript will continue to operate as normal.
